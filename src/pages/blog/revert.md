____________________________________________________________________________________________
So I'm a genius and forgot to renew my winbyte.one domain. Just going to go back to using the coriixyz name because I'm lazy.

I'm not too worried about it because I don't really use my domain much, just been too busy lately. Working, moving out a few months ago, and just plain exhaustion have prevented me from spending more time with this website.

I finally have a job that is related to IT and I will have way more time to work on my own projects now, though! I've been stuck in foodservice for close to 5 years working both days and nights and I'm so glad to not have to work there full time anymore. It's the main reason I haven't really been around much for the past 4-5 years and it's so relieving to have more time every day to focus on myself again.

To anyone who still remembers me and happens to stumble across this site, I hope you're doing well and feel free to reach out! 

Can't wait to work on this site more!!
